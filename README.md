# My Java & DSA Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, I document my progress in learning Java from basics to advanced topics, along with Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). 

## About Me
I'm currently exploring the world of Java development and sharpening my problem-solving skills with DSA. This repository serves as a journal of my learning process, projects, and code snippets as I progress from beginner to advanced levels.

## Journey Overview

### 1. **Basic Java Programs**
Simple Java exercises covering fundamental concepts like:
- Variables and Data Types
- Control Statements (if-else, loops)
- Functions and Methods
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### 2. **Intermediate Java Projects**
Projects focusing on:
- Collections (ArrayList, HashMap, etc.)
- File Handling
- Exception Handling
- Java Streams

### 3. **Advanced Java Concepts**
Exploration of:
- Multithreading
- Java Networking
- Design Patterns

### 4. **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**
Code challenges and problems related to:
- Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues
- Trees, Graphs, and Heaps
- Searching and Sorting Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion
